# Computing Activation Zone Boundaries for [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk/) Summits

The goal of this repository is to generate polygons that indicate the [activation zones](https://www.sota.org.uk/Blog/2017/07/08/In-The-Zone) for [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk/) summits. Here is how the [SOTA FAQ](https://www.sota.org.uk/Joining-In/FAQs) defines the activation zone: 

> Q. What is the Activation Zone?

> A. Often it is inconvenient to operate from the actual highest point of a summit, there may be structures there, or on a frequently visited summit there may be too many people about. The SOTA rules permit the operating position to be away from the summit but not more than 25 vertical metres below the summit. If you draw a contour line on a map 25 metres below the summit, the area within this contour is the Activation Zone. See this [MT blog posting](https://www.sota.org.uk/Blog/2017/07/08/In-The-Zone) for more information. If you operate from outside the AZ, the activation is not valid and will score no points.

For now this project only does summits in the W7W-KG area.

Let's load the libraries we'll need

```{r}
library(raster)
library(terra)
library(tidyterra)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggspatial)
```

Import a GeoJSON file containing the locations and elevations of SOTA summits. I got this file from https://sotl.as/summits/W7W/KG. 

```{r}
# get all summits via the GeoJSON download
gjsf <- st_read("input/W7W_KG.geojson")
```

Extract the location coordinates into columns so we can use them later, and create a column for elevation in meters because our raster data is in meters.

```{r}
# make sf data frame and get coords into cols we can use
gjsf_elev <- 
gjsf %>% 
  mutate(elev_m = parse_number(str_extract(title, ",\\s*(.*?)\\s*m")),
         elev_ft = elev_m * 3.2808399) %>% 
  mutate(x = st_coordinates(geometry)[,"X"],
         y = st_coordinates(geometry)[,"Y"])
```

Create a square buffer area of 1000m by 1000m around each summit, with the summit in the center. This is the area that we will download a raster of elevation data to compute the activation zone. This area is good enough for most summits, but for a few summits with very large activation zones it's too small, we'll deal with that later. 

```{r}
# make a single square buffer for each point
# Function to create the square buffers
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/70372149/1036500
bSquare <- function(x, a) {
  a <- sqrt(a)/2
  return( sf::st_buffer(x, dist = a, nQuadSegs=1, 
                        endCapStyle = "SQUARE") )
}

# get a buffer zone of a certain area
buffer_side_length <- 1e6 # 100 is a 10x10
gjsf_elev_buf <- 
bSquare(gjsf_elev, buffer_side_length)

gjsf_elev_buf_sq <- vector("list", nrow(gjsf_elev_buf))
for(i in 1:nrow(gjsf_elev_buf)){
  gjsf_elev_buf_sq[[i]] <- 
    st_bbox(gjsf_elev_buf[i,]) %>%
    st_as_sfc() %>%
    st_as_sf()
}

gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df <- 
  bind_rows(gjsf_elev_buf_sq)
```

Take a look at the buffer zones and summit points altogether

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df,
          colour = "red", fill = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = gjsf,
          size = 0.1) +
  coord_sf() +
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", 
                   width_hint = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Convert the buffer zone into a list of bounding box coordinates to input into the raster download function

```{r}
# get list of bounding boxes coords
gjsf_elev_buf_sq_bbx <- vector("list", nrow(gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df))
for(i in 1:nrow(gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df)){
  gjsf_elev_buf_sq_bbx[[i]] <- 
    gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df$x[i] %>% 
    st_coordinates() %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    select(X, Y)
}
```

Here is a loop that takes each summit and its bounding box and:

- downloads some raster tiles to cover the bounding box area
- then selects all the pixels in the raster that have an elevation value between the summit elevation and 25m below that elevation 
- then draw a polygon around those pixels
- then drop polygons that don't contain the summit point 
- then check if the activation zone polygon has the same dimension as the buffer zone, if it does, make the buffer zone much bigger and repeat the steps above to properly handle summits with unusually large activation zones
- then write the polygon of the activation zone to a GeoJSON file

The raster tiles come from the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Terrain Tiles](https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/). The resolution is probably 7-10 m per pixel at the zoom level we are using here. More details on resolution and zoom level is still available in the [documentation on ground resolution](https://github.com/tilezen/joerd/blob/master/docs/data-sources.md#what-is-the-ground-resolution).

Take a look at one of the summits and the activation zone we have computed for it:

```{r}
output$plot_summit_and_az
```

Inspect all the summits and activation zones in our set. Import the GeoJSON files and display the summit points and activation zones polygons on an interactive map. 

```{r results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

# import the GeoJSON files with the AZ polygons
gjson_files <- 
  list.files(path = "output",
             full.names = TRUE,
             recursive = TRUE)

az_files <- 
  map(gjson_files,
      st_read) 

names(az_files) <- str_remove_all(basename(gjson_files), 
                                  "output|.geojson")

summit_geometry <- 
  bind_rows(az_files, .id = "summit") %>% 
  select(summit, geometry)
```

This code block makes an interactive map of the summits and activation zones. On GitHub this shows as a static image.
