### Background

The goal of this repository is to generate polygons that indicate the [activation zones](https://www.sota.org.uk/Blog/2017/07/08/In-The-Zone) for [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk/) summits in the W7W-KG area. Here is how the [SOTA FAQ](https://www.sota.org.uk/Joining-In/FAQs) defines the activation zone:

> Q. What is the Activation Zone?

> A. Often it is inconvenient to operate from the actual highest point of a summit, there may be structures there, or on a frequently visited summit there may be too many people about. The SOTA rules permit the operating position to be away from the summit but not more than 25 vertical metres below the summit. If you draw a contour line on a map 25 metres below the summit, the area within this contour is the Activation Zone. See this [MT blog posting](https://www.sota.org.uk/Blog/2017/07/08/In-The-Zone) for more information. If you operate from outside the AZ, the activation is not valid and will score no points.

Prior work on computing activation zones includes: 

- the web app https://activation.zone/ by [Ara N6ARA](https://n6ara.com/) which uses 30m elevation data provided by the [elevation Python package](https://pypi.org/project/elevation/). 
- On [sotl.as](https://sotl.as/) activation zones are visible in the map view for HB/HB0 (calculated using [swissALTI3D](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/hoehenmodell-swissalti3d) data from swisstopo (spatial resolution 0.5 m, accuracy ± 0.3 – 3 m (1σ) depending on the region) and OE (calculated using BEV ALS DTM data (spatial resolution 1 m, accuracy generally ± 0.5 m, may vary in high altitude). The OE activation zones were computed by [Tobi OE7TOK](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/activation-zones-for-oe-on-sotlas/34629). 
- [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com/) can also be used to compute activation zones using the DEM shading tool on a desktop computer or smartphone (see [Tim N7KOM's](https://www.etsy.com/shop/N7KOMPortableRadio) [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UixA1Fc4D1c) on how to do this). CalTopo's elevation data is up to 1 meter resolution in many areas, which is based on LIDAR scans from the USGS's 3DEP program. This is currently the highest resolution freely available tool for on-the-fly computation of activation zone areas.  

The goal of these project is generate activation zone polygons as GeoJSON files that can be integrated into the sotl.as map. This is inspired by the work done for HB/HB0 and OE, where operators can view the activation zone polygon directly in the sotl.as map  Currently this project only does summits in the W7W-KG area. Here I use the R programming language to access the API for [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Terrain Tiles](https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/) to download a small raster file of elevation data for each summit, and compute the activation zone polygon and save it to a GeoJSON file. Higher resolution rasters are available at https://lidarportal.dnr.wa.gov/, but currently there is no API for these. 

### Acquire the data

Let's load the libraries we'll need

```{r}
library(raster)
library(terra)
library(tidyterra)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggspatial)
```

Import a GeoJSON file containing the locations and elevations of SOTA summits. I got this file from <https://sotl.as/summits/W7W/KG>.

```{r}
# get all summits via the GeoJSON download
gjsf <- st_read("input/W7W_KG.geojson")
```

Extract the location coordinates into columns so we can use them later, and create a column for elevation in meters because our raster data is in meters.

```{r}
# make sf data frame and get coords into cols we can use
gjsf_elev <- 
gjsf %>% 
  mutate(elev_m = parse_number(str_extract(title, ",\\s*(.*?)\\s*m")),
         elev_ft = elev_m * 3.2808399) %>% 
  mutate(x = st_coordinates(geometry)[,"X"],
         y = st_coordinates(geometry)[,"Y"])
```

Create a square buffer area of 1000m by 1000m around each summit, with the summit in the center. This is the area that we will download a raster of elevation data to compute the activation zone. This area is good enough for most summits, but for a few summits with very large activation zones it's too small, we'll deal with that later.

```{r}
# make a single square buffer for each point
# Function to create the square buffers
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/70372149/1036500
bSquare <- function(x, a) {
  a <- sqrt(a)/2
  return( sf::st_buffer(x, dist = a, nQuadSegs=1, 
                        endCapStyle = "SQUARE") )
}

# get a buffer zone of a certain area
buffer_side_length <- 1e6 # 100 is a 10x10
gjsf_elev_buf <- 
bSquare(gjsf_elev, buffer_side_length)

gjsf_elev_buf_sq <- vector("list", nrow(gjsf_elev_buf))
for(i in 1:nrow(gjsf_elev_buf)){
  gjsf_elev_buf_sq[[i]] <- 
    st_bbox(gjsf_elev_buf[i,]) %>%
    st_as_sfc() %>%
    st_as_sf()
}

gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df <- 
  bind_rows(gjsf_elev_buf_sq)
```

Take a look at the buffer zones and summit points altogether

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df,
          colour = "red", fill = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = gjsf,
          size = 0.1) +
  coord_sf() +
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", 
                   width_hint = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Convert the buffer zone into a list of bounding box coordinates to input into the raster download function

```{r}
# get list of bounding boxes coords
gjsf_elev_buf_sq_bbx <- vector("list", nrow(gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df))
for(i in 1:nrow(gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df)){
  gjsf_elev_buf_sq_bbx[[i]] <- 
    gjsf_elev_buf_sq_df$x[i] %>% 
    st_coordinates() %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    select(X, Y)
}
```

### Iterate over each summit to compute the activation zone polygon

Here is a loop that takes each summit and its bounding box and:

-   downloads some raster tiles to cover the bounding box area
-   then selects all the pixels in the raster that have an elevation value between the summit elevation and 25m below that elevation
-   then draw a polygon around those pixels
-   then drop polygons that don't contain the summit point
-   then check if the activation zone polygon has the same dimension as the buffer zone, if it does, make the buffer zone much bigger and repeat the steps above to properly handle summits with unusually large activation zones
-   then write the polygon of the activation zone to a GeoJSON file


This chunk of code takes several minutes to run and downloads raster tiles on each iteration of the loop. If you are viewing this in the [Binder](<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/computing-sota-az-boundaries/master?urlpath=rstudio>) instance, you can skip this step and jump down to where we [inspect the data](#inspect-all-the-summits-and-activation-zones-in-our-set)

After running the code block above we now have one GeoJSON file per summit with a polygon defining its activation zone in our `/output` directory.

Here are all the summits in W7W/KG (red points) and their activation zones as computed above (grey polygons):

```{r}
this_summit_point_df <- bind_rows(loop_output$this_summit_point) # 160 
this_summit_point_az_df <- bind_rows(loop_output$this_summit_point_az) # 160
poly_with_summit_df <- bind_rows(loop_output$poly_with_summit) %>% select(geometry) # 160

# take a look at the summits and AZs
  ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = poly_with_summit_df) + 
    geom_sf(data = this_summit_point_df,
            colour ="red",
            fill = NA,
            size = 0.1) +
    geom_text_repel(data = this_summit_point_df,
                    aes( x, y,
                         label = name),
                    bg.color = "white",
                    bg.r = 0.1,
                    size = 1.5,
                    segment.colour= "grey") +
    annotation_scale(location = "bl",

                    style =  "ticks") +
    coord_sf() +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 8)
```

Here is a close-up look at one summit and the activation zone we have computed for it:

Here's a comparison with two other methods. The green polygon is from https://activation.zone/?summitRef=W7W/KG-116 and the yellow polygon is the activation zone computed using the code above. The red-blue polygon is the activation zone determined by the Caltopo DEM shading tool. This map with the three activation zones is also online at https://caltopo.com/m/GPM5V

### Differences between summit elevation values in the SOTA data and in the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Terrain Tiles](https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/).

In developing this analysis I found that some summits have elevation values recorded in the SOTA data that are different from the elevation data in the Terrain Tiles. The differences in elevation of summits mean that some activation zones calculated here might not be accurate. In the plot below, the upper panel shows the full range of summits where the SOTA elevation differs from the Terrain Tiles, and the lower panel is a zoomed in view at -25m, 25m. The labelled summits, especially those in the top panel that deviate more than 20m, are ones where the activation zones computed here may be slightly inaccurate.

### Inspect all the summits and activation zones in our set

Import the GeoJSON files and display the summit points and activation zones polygons on an interactive map. To quickly explore these data without downloading anything, and use the interactive map in your web browser, [click here to open an instance of RStudio in your browser tab](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/computing-sota-az-boundaries/master?urlpath=rstudio)

```{r results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

# import the GeoJSON files with the AZ polygons
gjson_files <- 
  list.files(path = "output",
             full.names = TRUE,
             recursive = TRUE)

az_files <- 
  map(gjson_files,
      st_read) 

names(az_files) <- str_remove_all(basename(gjson_files), 
                                  "output|.geojson")

summit_geometry <- 
  bind_rows(az_files, .id = "summit") %>% 
  select(summit, geometry)
```

This code block makes an interactive map of the summits and activation zones. On GitHub this shows as a static image. Here we have zoomed in on [W7W/KG-142 Union Hill](https://sotl.as/summits/W7W/KG-142) which is remarkable because it has a very large activation zone that includes an elementary school and recreational park at the north end.

```{r}
library(leaflet)

gjsf <- st_read("input/W7W_KG.geojson")

l <- 
leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap") %>% 
  addPolygons(data = summit_geometry,
              color = "red", 
              weight = 1) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(data = gjsf %>% 
                     mutate(id = str_replace_all(id, "/|-", "_")) %>% 
                     filter(id %in% summit_geometry$summit ),
                   radius = 1,
                   weight = 1,
                   label = ~id,
                   labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T, 
                                               direction = "top",
                                               offset = c(0, -15))) %>% 
   setView(-122, 47.66,  zoom = 15)  %>%
  addScaleBar()


l # open the interactive map for panning and zooming over all the summits
